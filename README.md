# Squares
Squares is a little puzzle game where your goal is to get numbered boxes back in order. In particular this mean starting with the smallest number in the top-left corner, increasing to the top-right corner, continuing in the following rows until the largest number in the bottom-right corner. In a standard game, there are nine consecutive numbers to sort.

You can use the little 'knobs' in between the numbered boxes to switch boxes clockwise around the knob.

Have fun!
